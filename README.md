# Overwatch League Lengendary Skins (OWLLS)
A GitHub Pages version of a website for browsing the Overwatch League legendary skins.

## Motivation & Purpose
As Overwatch doesn't provide a way of viewing all available Overwatch League legendary skins while they're out of store rotation, and existing documentation of all these skins and their past availability is poor at best, I decided to research and document this information myself, and then provide a way to easily view it.

While I use a self-hosted PHP version for myself, I also wanted to share and host something simpler for others, so I decided to create this GitHub Pages version for the public.

## Sorting & Filtering
The display of skins is ordered by skin name, and can be easily filtered by hero, skin name and/or current availability. Custom ordering and additional filters for things like season and hero's role may come in the future, but feels excessive currently.

## Data
Data for each skin is in JSON and contains the name, hero, season and event they were originally released for, themes behind their creation, an official article link about their creation/release if available, and their availability. The availability is a full list of each period a skin has been available for, with corresponding source and cost, and links to official references as evidence for that period.

## Contributing
If you spot any issues in the data, please raise an issue or pull request to fix it, along with any supporting links if it's new/contradictory info.

Code optimisations & suggestions and bug fixes are welcome, though performance is not a priority with this project (I don't even use this version myself).

If there's interest, I may add support for other languages (at least as many as [the Overwatch League website](https://overwatchleague.com) supports) in the future.
